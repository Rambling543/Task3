In this task i have Loaded student_data.csv using pandas,Checked for missing values and inspected column names.Chosen 'attendence' as the input feature (X) and 'marks' as the target variable (y) for simple linear regression and i have Used train_test_split to divide data into 80% training and 20% testing then Applied LinearRegression() from sklearn.linear_model to fit the model to training data.Evaluated performance using:
MAE (Mean Absolute Error),MSE (Mean Squared Error),RÂ² Score (Coefficient of Determination)and Plotted actual vs predicted data using matplotlib.Displayed the model's intercept and coefficient to understand the relationship between hours attended and marks.
